## About Us

We are two students from Germany who created hardhat and coreminer for our Hochschule.

## Our Projects

### üî© [Coreminer](https://github.com/TalpaLabs/coreminer)
A powerful debugger for Linux written in Rust that provides low-level debugging capabilities, particularly for programs that resist conventional debugging approaches. Coreminer gives you deep control over program execution with robust DWARF debug information parsing.

### üîç [HardHat](https://github.com/TalpaLabs/hardhat)  
A Textual User Interface (TUI) for Coreminer that enhances the debugging experience while maintaining the flexibility and power of the command line.
